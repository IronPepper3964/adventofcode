# Advent of Code Repository

This code is my attempts to solve the Advent of Code puzzles, starting with 2025 (day 6).

## My Goals:
1. Solve all 2025 puzzles before the end of the year
2. Do not use AI unless I have solved the problem myself at least once
3. Solutions should be generalized as much as possible
    * Example - if the puzzle input file contains 3 rows of numbers, the code should be able to handle an arbitrary amount of rows and not rely on the file containing exactly 3 lists (unless the puzzle explicitly states a static number).

## Allowances:
1. Solutions do not need to be production grade.
2. Solutions do not need to follow best practices
2. Documentation is optional
3. Error handling is optional (and generally expected to be skipped)

## Optional Goals:
* Complete previous years puzzles
* Cleanup existing solutions
    * Use best practices
    * Add Documentation
    * Improve approaches to solving the puzzles
